Outline of workflow for BIOL709b project


Project objective: to understand the mobr package, troubleshoot, annotate and make the 
underlying code accessible 
My github for this class contains Rmd documents for each of the bubbles in my workflow. 
Functions are further outlined there. This document is to give you an idea of the overall 
workflow and different pieces. 



Workflow bubble 1:

- Prepare data in format that can be input. 
- Create mobr object for further calculations

main function:
make_mob_in()



Workflow bubble 2:
- Explore data by plotting and calculating basic diversity metrics
- Get an idea of what you might expect/where you might see differences in the results

main function:
plot()





Workflow bubble 3:
- Plot diversity components across scales.
- Compare diversity components at local and group scales. 
- Understand turnover between scales. 

main function:
get_mob_stats()






Workflow bubble 4:
- compare diversity components between categories/types/treatments across scales
- Plot how much of the difference in species richness between categories can be attributed 
to evenness, spatial aggregation and differences in numbers of individuals. Also showing 
to what extent the role of these different factors varies across scale.

main function:
get_delta_stats





Workflow bubble 5:
- Interpret!
(does not have an R script)
